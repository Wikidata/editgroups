Testing
=======

EditGroups comes with an extensive test suite, that can be run using Django's testing tools: ``python manage.py test``.
This will create a test database, so that the changes made do not interfere with any production database.

We encourage any prospective contributors to embrace a test-driven development approach and write tests for as many
scenarios as possible. Contributions without tests are still gratefully received.
