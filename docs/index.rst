   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to EditGroups's documentation!
======================================

EditGroups is an application that groups Wikidata edits into logical batches.
The purpose of this grouping is to give a brids-eye overview over data imports
and maintenance tasks happening in Wikidata, provide a simple mechanism to refer
to and discuss these batches, and undo them in a few clicks.

Documentation for users can be found `on Wikidata itself <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Edit_groups>`_.
This manual is for developers
who want to contribute to EditGroups, interact with it through its API, extend it,
deploy it on other wikis, and so on. If you are just trying to add a tool to the Wikidata EditGroups instance,
just use the `instructions for tool developers <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Edit_groups/Adding_a_tool>`_.
